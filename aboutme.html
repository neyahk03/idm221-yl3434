    <p>
        Hello, my name is Yen Luong, and my journey through life has taken me on a remarkable path from my hometown in Vietnam to the vibrant Bay Area of California and now to the lively city of Philadelphia, where Iâ€™m pursuing my passion for design.
    </p>
    <p>
        My story begins in Vietnam, where I spent the first 17 years of my life. The rich culture and heritage of my hometown have profoundly influenced my design philosophy. It's not just where I'm from; it's who I am, and that essence permeates every aspect of my work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The more I delve into the world of design, the deeper my love for it grows. Design, to me, is more than just a profession; it's a medium through which I can express myself and represent my Vietnamese culture, my "Viet," to the world. Each design I create is a canvas where my heritage and creativity unite to tell a unique story.
        </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, you'll often find me with my headphones on, immersed in the world of music or creating beautiful crocheted pieces. These creative outlets fuel my imagination and contribute to my design process.
    </p>

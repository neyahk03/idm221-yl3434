## About me <a id="aboutme"></a>

Hello, my name is Yen Luong, and my journey through life has taken me on a remarkable path from my hometown in Vietnam to the vibrant Bay Area of California and now to the lively city of Philadelphia, where Iâ€™m pursuing my passion for design. 

My story begins in Vietnam, where I spent the first 17 years of my life. The rich culture and heritage of my hometown have profoundly influenced my design philosophy. It's not just where I'm from; it's who I am, and that essence permeates every aspect of my work.

The more I delve into the world of design, the deeper my love for it grows. Design, to me, is more than just a profession; it's a medium through which I can express myself and represent my Vietnamese culture, my "Viet," to the world. Each design I create is a canvas where my heritage and creativity unite to tell a unique story.

In my free time, you'll often find me with my headphones on, immersed in the world of music or creating beautiful crocheted pieces. These creative outlets fuel my imagination and contribute to my design process.

It aims to challenge this assumption and shed light on the complexities and realities of such a decision. Through captivating visuals and poignant messaging, the poster serves as a reminder that while migration can offer new opportunities, the pursuit of wealth should not overshadow the importance of cultural roots, personal fulfillment, and community connections. It encourages viewers to contemplate the multifaceted aspects of migration and consider the broader implications beyond monetary gain, ultimately sparking a deeper reflection on the true meaning of success and happiness in a globalized world.

### Boba Shop Logo Redesign <a id="logo"></a>

![TeaStation](<project/business card-logo design.jpg>)

My project is centered on the revitalization of a boba shop's brand identity, including a fresh new logo and redesigned business cards. Drawing inspiration from the letter "T" and the imagery of a leaf, the logo concept symbolizes both the shop's name and the essence of freshness that sets boba beverages apart.

The vibrant green color selected for the logo embodies the vitality and zest that our boba shop represents. My primary goal is to craft a visually captivating brand identity that not only resonates with my target audience but also encapsulates the essence of my signature boba creations.

Incorporating this new logo into my business card design, I aim to create a lasting impression on my valued customers. The business cards will prominently feature the revitalized logo alongside essential contact information, ensuring that every interaction with our brand leaves a memorable mark.

My project endeavors to breathe new life into our boba shop's identity, infusing it with a sense of freshness and vibrancy that mirrors the exceptional quality of our beverages. Through this redesign, I seek to reaffirm my commitment to delivering an unforgettable boba experience to my patrons.
